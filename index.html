        Next, we initialize the camera 

        The code below specifies a camera that can be controlled with a keyboard
        and by looking around with a mouse. The camera is positioned inside a "rig".
        
        Let us not worry about the camera for now. A-Frame takes care of most of the setup for us.

        ## Entities
        An A-Frame scene consists of entities.
        Entities are custom html tags of type `<a-entity>`.
        Do not forget the closing tag `</a-entity>`.
        
        Entities by themselves do not contain or display anything.
        To make an entity do something you need to assign components to them.
        
        Component are specified in the opening <a-entity> tag
          Example (below):
          - `geometry` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a geometry (a shape)
          - `material` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a material (color/texture)
          - `position` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a place in space (coordinates)
          - `rotation` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity is rotated in space somehow (expressed using Euler angles)
          - `id` is **not** an A-Frame component; it is an HTML attribute; it specifies a unique identifier for the element

        Components/attributes come usually in name/value pairs.
